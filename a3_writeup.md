# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.


2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?


3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?


4. What chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
I would create a chatbot, similar to this, that focuses on horror video games. I would create it because it is October (hence the fosu on horror) and because horror video games like Five Nights at Freddy's and Amnesia are well-known. WHAT THIS CHATBOT WOULD DO IS (FINISH THIS PART)

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
The most difficult portion of this assignment was the 'search_pa_list" because I didn't really know how to approach it.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
